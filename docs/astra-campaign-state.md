# UTAMO OS — Astra Systems Campaign State

Campaign branch: `astra-campaign`. Local development only; no push, merge into
main, release or public tag is authorized during the campaign.

| Field | Current value |
| --- | --- |
| Current milestone | v0.3.0 — Kernel Heap |
| Current status | IMPLEMENTING; gates pending |
| Highest GREEN milestone | v0.2.0 baseline |
| Last known good commit | `f73951185755da40c85467de99749611f6ab66dc` |
| Kernel version | 0.2.0 until the heap milestone passes |
| Host validation | Baseline: 11,224 checks, 0 failures |
| ELF validation | Baseline: 1,439 checks, 0 failures |
| QEMU validation | Baseline: 1,550 checks, 0 failures; 13 sequential VMs reaped |
| Known blockers | None observed |
| Next task | Implement/test heap core and transactional PMM/VMM backing, then integrate shell/stress |

## Last known good history

| Milestone | Status | Commit | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| v0.2.0 | GREEN baseline | `f73951185755da40c85467de99749611f6ab66dc` | `validation-artifacts/astra-baseline-20260914T071530Z/` |

Baseline was rebuilt from a clean build directory before campaign edits:
host, cross kernel, ELF/ABI, ISO and the full existing headless matrix passed.
Counts describe these runs, not future builds. Frozen artifacts are kept
locally in `validation-artifacts/astra-last-known-good/v0.2.0/`.

## Campaign gates

Implement → host tests → kernel build → ELF/ABI → ISO → headless QEMU →
stress/negative tests → audit → commit → last known good → next milestone.

A failed dependent gate stops advancement. Record its cause, attempts and safe
next action here; never replace an earlier GREEN entry with an incomplete one.
Version/changelog advance only after evidence supports a GREEN milestone.

Priority: v0.3 heap; v0.4 kernel threads/preemptive scheduler; v0.5 isolated
Ring 3 processes/syscalls; v0.6 VFS/initramfs/ELF userspace. Storage v0.7 and
networking v0.8 begin only after all prerequisites pass. No GUI, SMP, USB or audio.

## Preserved references and constraints

- `main` / `origin/main`: `109fe33fa839a585861a135a85d60ddda9428c92`.
- `v0.1.0` tag object: `0187e97b34e23c78671b317b71b1e3090d76506d`.
- `v0.0.1`: `273e47634b113497cfb667a4c9de602420634e2c`.
- `v0.2-dev` remains at the baseline commit above.
- Existing cross compiler, Binutils, NASM and Limine are reused without updates.
- All QEMU runs are headless, bounded, sequential and explicitly reaped.
- Manual/visual, UEFI and physical hardware acceptance remain separate evidence.
